The solution which we have build make the life of vocally impaired people more comfortable and people who wants to learn music i.e wants to learn guitar in a more effective way.

The main problem suffered by a musician is to learn the chords of a guitar ,here we'll provide the solution for that by recognizing the hand gestures(chord gesture) of the teacher and then turning that gesture into a voice of the chord which will lay a big impact on the student to learn that chord easily in a more effective way.

It also bridges the communication gap between the normal and the abnormal people. The deaf and dumb people need not only learn the standard sign language but the core issue is that they can communicate with the normal people of society. It is also not possible for all the normal people that they learn the sign language to understand whatever is said through gestures. So the communicational gap still stays there even after teaching deaf and dumb people with sign language.In this project, an approach has been presented in which statistical features are extracted from the hand signs and are then fed  for the recognition of the hand gestures. In this  the English alphabet gestures data set has been used and the recognized hand gestures are then represented as both the alphabetical and voice forms. This would help the impaired people to to communicate with normal people in in a comfortable way . 

In this we have used an app which act as a medium between person who cannot speak but uses sign language to communicate and teacher who wants to teach the chords of a guitar 

The app will give output in the form of voice by taking the input gestures
